ANARCHIA

Recently I saw a ufo in Berlin
in Kreuzberg near the Heinrichplatz
with bunch of colorful creatures in
they jumped out the ship like cats.

"Hello, we live on star Anarchia
and we heard the earth is wack.
So we like to stay a few days here
and then we're flying back."

At first the folk all looked confused
then appeared two plucky punks
asking: "We've never heard of you,
neither of your star,
do you have mosh pits up on your chunks?"

"Moshpit I admit", one creature said,
but suddenly t'was crazy loud,
everywhere stood pigs, armed with nightsticks
panic spread among the crowd.

Few people bravely grabbed for sticks and stones
while others took a stool.
But the aliens just opened a little console
and said to us: "Keep cool!"

Then I saw a flash and all the cops were gone,
I said "The hell, what is this marv'lous trick?"
They answered me "There is no trick,
we beamed the pigs away,
to the ghetto of the stinkrich dicks."

The space – this endless zone.
The earth – that creepy stone.

I told you just a fairy tale that never happened so
but it could be just 'round the bend,
spaceships flyin' around with aliens on board
that visit us ev'ry now and then.

Anyway that story's living in my heart
and it gives my dreams huge wings.
even if Anarchia is merely just a star
I really like that little thing.
