# Anarchia
A short animation film to the song **Anarchia** inspired by [Yok aka Quetschenpaua](https://pocketpunk.so36.net/).

- **Director**: [Jan Kosyk](https://klavierpunk.de)

The whole animation is done in the browser with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/). The IDE used is [Apache NetBeans 12.0](https://netbeans.apache.org/). Images are done by me or grabbed at [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com). Some images are not public domain; these are excluded from the commits. All images will be replaced with drawings by the wonderful [Alina Milkina](https://alinamilkina.carbonmade.com).

The music is based on the song [Ufo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amAJ6HU9Jac) by [Quetschenpaua](https://pocketpunk.so36.net/). The text is translated into English by me and will be recorded with piano, guitar, bass and drums. There will also a German version with the original text.
