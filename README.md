# Anarchia
A short animation film to the song **Anarchia** inspired by [Yok aka Quetschenpaua](https://pocketpunk.so36.net/).

- **Director**: [Jan Kosyk](https://klavierpunk.de)

The whole animation is done in the browser with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/). The IDE used is [Apache NetBeans 18.0](https://netbeans.apache.org/). Images are done by me or grabbed at [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com). The city and houses are made by the wonderful [Alina Milkina](https://alinamilkina.carbonmade.com).

The music is based on the song [Ufo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amAJ6HU9Jac) by the outstanding [Yok Quetschenpaua](https://pocketpunk.so36.net/). The text is translated into English by me with the help of the great [Brad Hock](https://www.instagram.com/bardo.bread/). There is also a Japanese version made by [Hirai Masaya](https://instagram.com/hiraimasaya).
