# Anarchia
A short animation film to the song **Anarchia** inspired by [Yok aka Quetschenpaua](https://pocketpunk.so36.net/).

- **Director**: [Jan Kosyk](https://klavierpunk.de)

The whole animation is done in the browser with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/). The IDE used is [Apache NetBeans 18.0](https://netbeans.apache.org/). Images are done by me or grabbed at [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com). The city and houses are made by the wonderful [Alina Milkina](https://alinamilkina.carbonmade.com).

The music is based on the song [Ufo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amAJ6HU9Jac) by the outstanding [Yok Quetschenpaua](https://pocketpunk.so36.net/). The text is translated into English by me with the help of the great Brad Hock. There is also a German version with the original text and a Japanese version made by [Hirai Masaya](https://instagram.com/hiraimasaya).

The music for the German cover »Autonomia« and the English version »Anarchia« was recorded at the [Virtuous Vibes Studio](https://virtuose-vibes.de). The Japanese version was recorded at [AT HALL](https://www.instagram.com/at__hall/) in Beppu (Japan) by [Ryosuke Ueno](https://www.instagram.com/ueno1gou/).
